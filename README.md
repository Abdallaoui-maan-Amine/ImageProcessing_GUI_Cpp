# ImageProcessing_GUI_Cpp



## The objectif of this project is to create a GUI using C++/QT and to compare our algorithms with OpenCV methods. It give the possibilty to manage the images descriptors.


**This GUI contains severals algorithm sush as : **

  1. Histogram.

  2. Noise filtering:
  
      i. Average filter.
      
      ii. Median filter.

  3. Edge detection:
  
      i. Gradient filter.
      
      ii. Laplacien filter.
      
      iii. Canny filter.

  4. Edge enhancement.
  
  5. Hough algorithm.
  
  
**Descriptor Management : **

  1. Add image.
  
  2. Update image.
  
  3. Delete image.
  
  4. Sort Data.
  
  5. Filter Data.
